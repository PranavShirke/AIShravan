AIShravan is an accessibility-focused web platform designed to empower Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals to communicate effortlessly in everyday situations.

The platform integrates **speech recognition, text-to-speech, hand gesture interpretation, sign-language learning resources, and an AI assistant** into a single unified application.

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission Overview

**Theme:** Accessibility & Inclusive Technology  
**Objective:** Bridge communication gaps using AI-powered multimodal interfaces.

AIShravan was developed to demonstrate how modern web technologies and AI tools can work together to create real-world social impact by improving daily communication for people with hearing impairments.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals often face barriers in:

- Understanding spoken conversations in public spaces  
- Communicating verbally with non-signers  
- Accessing sign-language learning tools easily  
- Navigating digital systems not designed for accessibility  

Most existing solutions address only **one** mode of interaction (speech, text, or gestures) instead of providing a unified experience.

AIShravan aims to:

- ♿ Enable inclusive real-time conversations  
- 📱 Provide easy-to-use communication tools on the web  
- 📚 Promote learning of sign language
